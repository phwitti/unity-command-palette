# Find Editor Tools (Unity)
Adds a shortcut to unity on Ctrl+T (like 'Tools') to open a command palette that includes all commands that are available in the menu (including all the custom menu-items that are added in your personal project).

Due to thousands of Editor-Tools in our projects at Mimimi Games, we needed a way to not loose track of them and find them more quickly -- this tool is the answer to that.

## Features
- Search & Execute Menu Items
- Automatically 'Rates' items that are used more often and pushes them to the top
- One can additionally Pin/Favorite items, so they're always shown at the top
